# Amazon-Clone-Using-Html-CSS-Only-
<br>
This project is a simple **Amazon Clone** built using **HTML and CSS only**. It replicates the basic layout and design of Amazonâ€™s homepage, including the navigation bar, product sections, and footer. The main goal of this project is to practice front-end development skills, improve web page structuring, and enhance styling techniques using pure CSS.
